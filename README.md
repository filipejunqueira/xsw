# xsw

This is Chris Judd GUI implementation of David Duncan's code for fitting XSW data. 
READ THE Guide to NIXSW fitting.pdf.

All credit goes to David Duncan and Chris Judd. This is not my code. I'm just uploading for the benefit of the Nanoscience group at UoN. This code will eventually be transfer to NanoNotts github.
